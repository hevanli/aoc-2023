Here are all my solutions for Advent of Code 2023! 

Now if for some reason you're stalking my Github, and for some reason you fell upon this repository, 
and for some reason you are reading this, and for some reason you managed to catch that I'm not 
actually doing this in 2023, well that's amazing. 

But also, it's because I was swamped in college applications and so I'm doing them now, in 
January of 2024. Go me! Hope I can look back on this README with a little satisfaction from the 
future where I've gotten into a university that I'm happy with.
